Community Cleanup Day at Kamand Campus
======================================

Men with good character are usually pious and God-fearing. They stick to
certain morals in their life. Thus, having a God fearing or clean heart is
the first step to being godly. In other words, godliness should begin from
the heart.

"Community Clean-up activity" with this idea IIT Mandi NSS team organized
cleanliness camp at Kamand campus of IIT Mandi on May 3rd, 2015. A group of
more than 60 NSS volunteers, staff and faculty of IIT Mandi, participated in
this camp in the context of this idea. The campaign resulted in the
collection of more than 100 bags of waste materials as Part of a "Community
Clean-up" day at Kamand. Everyone who had participated in the cleanliness
drive had put in a lot of efforts to clean up the campus and make it
garbage-free. The movement has now as well started and it is going to get
only bigger, as one of the central pillars of our plans to serve the society
by maintaining the beauty of the scintillating Himalayan landscape.
