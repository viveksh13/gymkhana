NSS IIT Mandi organized Blood Donation Camp
==========================================

Blood Donation is service to Humankind, By Donating Blood you help a needy
and save a precious life.

Transfusion of blood every year saves Millions of life all over the world
every year, there are Millions of Blood Donors all over the world but still
India don't have adequate number of blood suppliers and face the challenge
of blood supply to the patients. Keeping in view the problem of acute blood
shortage, A Blood Donation Camp was organized by the NSS unit of IIT Mandi
in collaboration with Blood bank zonal hospital, Mandi.

It began at around 11 a.m. and continued up to 3 p.m., with a steady stream
of donors throughout. Students, faculty and staff members participated
voluntarily in the camp. Volunteers helped the people and gave moral support
to the donors. CR-1 (Stable Complex) was utilized for a thorough medical
check-up of potential donors as well as for the donation. Donors were
provided with the refreshments, later. In total 56 units of blood was
collected. The blood were carefully sealed and transported to the blood
bank. We thank IIT Mandi campus community for coming forward for this great
cause. This camp helped students in getting awareness about their social
responsibilities and showed enthusiastic participation for the same. Someone
lives when someone donates.
