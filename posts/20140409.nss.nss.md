Literacy programme for Migrant Children
=======================================

NSS unit IIT Mandi has taken a vital step by starting a 'literacy programme'
for the children of migrant labourers working in the campus of Kamand, IIT
Mandi on April 29th, 2014. This programme was inaugurated by Dr Priscilla
Gonsalves in the presence of NSS team and faculty members. Books, notebooks,
stationary, cloths and footwear were distributed to those children. They are
very enthusiastic and eager to learn. Although the focus of the programme is
on promoting children's literacy, the NSS unit will also take care of their
nutritional requirements. It is decided by the NSS team that every day along
with knowledge/awareness, nutritious food/fruits will also be served to
these children.
