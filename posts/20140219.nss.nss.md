On 15th & 16th February, 2014 NSS unit of BITS PILANI organized a Youth
Conference. A team of 3 members, Rajat Valecha (B13220), Shubham Chandel
(B13231), Prashant Kumar (B12072) represented IIT Mandi in the event. They
presented the detailed report of what NSS unit of IIT Mandi did in the past
year. There were eight other teams which participated in this event. These
teams were from major colleges across India like IIT Delhi, Shree Ram
College, Lady Shree Ram College and DTU. This was a great opportunity for
our members to interact with other NSS members. They also got to know what
other NSS units are doing and their future plans. All the teams shared the
problems faced by them in their respective areas and the ideas to tackle
those.
