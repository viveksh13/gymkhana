Tree Plantation Camp at Kamand Campus
=====================================

The National Service Scheme (NSS), IIT Mandi organized a Tree Plantation
Programme in the college premises on August 31, 2014 from 9am onwards. NSS
candidates identified appropriate places for plantation of plants and
prepared it for plantation. It was attended by Prof Timothy A Gonsalves,
Director, Faculty members, NSS committee members and more than 50 student
volunteers. The students also placed tree barricades and each student took
the responsibility to nourish and maintain the allocated plant. Eventually,
the campus attained a glorious look. The NSS committee decided to proceed
with the same inspiration and enthusiasm to enhance the beauty of the
college campus.
