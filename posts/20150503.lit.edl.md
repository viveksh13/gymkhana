JAM conducted by EDLS as part of Lounge event series
====================================================

As a part of Lounge activities, EDLS conducted a Just A Minute(JAM) session on May 3, 2015 at 7 pm, though not in the lounge but out in the mess courtyard owing to the cool nocturnal breeze which is a speciality of the Kamand campus. Funny and engaging as JAMs always are, this edition too saw  amazing participants, throwing away witty remarks and showing off their literary prowess. Spanned over 4 rounds, the JAM witnessed an outstanding display of rich English lexicon of the participants, constant watch to pick one another's tidbit-iest of mistakes and gripping tension which rose as rounds went by. Sagar Ghai was the JAM Master and certainly had his share of controversies and arguments in resolving ties. Deepika Kalyan had kindly consented to be the timekeeper of the event. Farah Anjum, B.Tech II year, CSE secured I position while Shruti Garg, B.Tech II year, CSE stood second after a long and tough fight. All in all, this event proved to rejuvenate the oral English skills of the populace and provided mental fuel to the literary ones.
